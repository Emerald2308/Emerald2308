## About me

Hi there! I'm Swati, and I'm on an exciting journey to master DevOps. Iâ€™m looking forward to constantly update my Cloud and DevOps projects, ensuring I learn something new every day. Along the way, Iâ€™m documenting my experiences through blogs to share insights and lessons learned.

I'm particularly interested in exploring how DevOps practices can be applied in emerging fields like AI, ML, and Web3. By integrating these technologies, I aim to innovate and streamline processes, creating more efficient workflows and robust applications.

Join me as I navigate this dynamic landscape, share my progress, and delve into the intersection of DevOps with cutting-edge technologies!
