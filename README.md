## 👋 About Me

Hi there! I'm **Swati**, a curious engineer on an exciting journey to master **DevOps**, **Site Reliability**, and all things infrastructure.

🌱 I’m continuously expanding my expertise in:
- Cloud-native tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform)
- Monitoring and Observability
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automation & Scripting
- And exploring the intersections of **DevOps + AI**, **ML**, and **Web3**

🛠️ I'm currently building a full-stack **DevOps-powered portfolio site**, and I write blogs to share real-world lessons, gotchas, and exciting findings from the trenches.
